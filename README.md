SImple app for sharing lists. 
  
## Installation

First of all you should install Angular and NestJS CLI's:

```console
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

Then clone this repository:

```console

```

## Development

To start Angular development server use:

```

To start NestJS back-end in development mode:
